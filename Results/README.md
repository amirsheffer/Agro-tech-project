# Short data analysis:
- Night-time temperature is uniform throughout the sensors.
- Temperature is greatly influenced by shading. Eastern temperatures are hot from the morning to noon, western temperatures are high from afternoon to sunset.
- The southern wall has a wet mattress cooling system, in both cases, it is visible that the southern side is cooler than the northern one.
Things to improve in future versions:
- A symmetrical sensor placement would improve interpolation.
- 3D modeling considering the roof as a separate surface, would improve viability.
- Add a time-controlling slider to the animation, would help better analyze the results.
