# an Agro-tech-project
The project sets a meterorological measurments system to a 15*6.5*3 greenhouse parametere on 14 points

components list:

electronics:

- 7 esp32 microprocessors
- 7DS18B20 Temperature Sensor mounted on a water-proof mount and 1.5 m cable
- 7 SHT31 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- 7 breadboards
- 4.7k Ohm resistors
- jumper wires

hardware:

- electric wires
- electric power supply (5V)
- electric boxes

the project's product are:
- a  time changing 2D heatmap of the greenhouses main wall (measuring T, RH and calculation VPD), the western and eastern one.
with two etrapolated points on each wall, and a grid of interpolated point
- a set-up for a clone measurment experiment inside the greenhouse, which will enable to quentify the greenhouses effect on the local micro-climte.
