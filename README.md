# Outer 3D heatmap model of a greenhouse (Final project for agrotech course)
In this project we will build an esp32 based system to measure the temperature outside of a greenhouse.
This system can help with regulating the temperatures inside the greenhouse as we can compare the inside temperature to the outside temperature thus checking if there are any faults in the greenhouse and to improve the functions of the greenhouse. With this system you can also measure the humidity and VPD outside the greenhouse and compare it as well to the readings inside.
