Software and data analysis:
- Two codes were used on the esp32 (written in C++).
	1) To find the address of the DS18B20 sensor
	2) To program the sensors to measure and communicate with a ‘thinkspeak’ cloud via WiFi
- Data analysis and visualization were done in python, and include 3 codes:
	1) 3D visualization of the greenhouse
	2) data importing and organizing
	3) 2D interpolation and extrapolation of the data to each face of the greenhouse (east and west). Visualization through a heatmap, the time dimension was animated using a GIF file.


Notes on the code:
- Two points (0,3.25,3) and (15,3.25,3) were extrapolated using the other points on the roof, to create a rectangular data set to interpolate from.
- sensor 3 data was irrelevant, and therefore replaced by the closest sensor.
-the minimum and maximum values for the heat map were set by the minimum and maximum values of sensor 4 and sensor 1.

How to process:
1) Run ‘data processing’
2) Run ‘2D modeling’ (might take some time to run)
